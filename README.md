# Linear Regression

This repository contains various examples of statistical learning methods and algorithms, created to gain a better and intuitive understanding of the basics of statistical learning.
The implementations were developed based on concepts from the book [*Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*](https://www.statlearning.com/).

## Introduction

This project was originally intended and made for my personal learning and use. The implementations provided here serve as a means to explore and comprehend fundamental statistical learning concepts.
Please note that the primary purpose of these examples are educational and for experimentation

## Folder Structure

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Implementation of simple linear regression algorithm.
- **Multivariable Linear Regression**: Implementation of multivariable linear regression algorithm.

## Usage

Each model implementation is contained within its respective folder. To run the code, make sure you have Python (or any other applicable programming language) and the necessary libraries installed, as specified in the individual code files.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the work that was put into *Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*. Various Implementations and definitions were adopted and used for this *Learning Repository* of mine.
